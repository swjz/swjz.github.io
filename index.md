# Hi!

I am currently a fifth-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Chicago, advised by [Sanjay Krishnan](http://sanjayk.io/){:target="_blank"}.
My research interests include streaming systems for real-time multimodal serving.

## Projects

**EdgeServe** is a real-time model serving system that optimizes the movements of multimodal streaming data. [[Website]](https://edgeserve.org/){:target="_blank"} [[GitHub]](https://github.com/swjz/EdgeServe){:target="_blank"}

- **EdgeServe: A Streaming System for Decentralized Model Serving** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08028.pdf){:target="_blank"}  
**Ted Shaowang** and Sanjay Krishnan.  
_In submission._

- **Sensor Fusion on the Edge: Initial Experiments in the EdgeServe System** [[Paper]](assets/pdf/bidede22-shaowang.pdf){:target="_blank"}

**AMIR** (Active Multimodal Interaction Recognition) is a framework for activity recognition that trains independent models for video and network data respectively, and subsequently combines the predictions from both models using a meta-learning method.
