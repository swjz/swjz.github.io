# Hi!

I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Chicago, advised by [Sanjay Krishnan](http://sanjayk.io/){:target="_blank"}.
My research interests include edge-based data systems and video analytics.

## Projects

**EdgeServe** is a decentralized model serving system that optimizes data movements and model placements within an edge cluster. [[Link]](https://github.com/swjz/EdgeServe){:target="_blank"}

**AMIR** (Active Multimodal Interaction Recognition) is a framework for activity recognition that trains independent models for video and network data respectively, and subsequently combines the predictions from both models using a meta-learning method.
