# About me

I am currently a final year undergraduate student at Tsinghua University. Previously, I was a research intern at Stanford University under the supervision of [Prof. Kayvon Fatahalian](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kayvonf/).

My passion is to optimize distributed data-intensive systems and make them easily accessible to everyone.
